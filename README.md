# 🍽 Meals App

This is a simple meals listing app that I made for practing React Native styling,
but also for using Nested Navigators with [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/),
the React Context API and also [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) as an alternative for Context API.
